# gCTS - Configuration, Customizing and Usage of gCTS on a SAP System S/4HANA 2020 FPS01

In this document I describe the steps to configure, customize and first steps to use the git enabled transport system (gCTS).

The steps depend on the description from SAP Help documentation which links are mostly used in this documentation. Some tasks described there are included here but to get thropugh all steps you have to include them also. I added the links to each parts to the different help pages in the chapters. 
Nevertheless this document will not completely cover every step and some tasks may differ on other system enviroments.
As there was only a single system available, there are no steps for setting up things which need  a more complex landscape (e.g. setup pipelines to transport between systems)
Please keep in mind, that this document is only a rough manual of necessary steps and give you an idea of all activities.

### 1. Introduction  

https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/f319b168e87e42149e25e13c08d002b9.html

1.1. Concept  

https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/3c24c83b2c0a4eee83cac387f96905ee.html  
The following is an overview of the process:
![gCTS Concept](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_concept.png)  
Features of Git-Enabled Change and Transport System  
gCTS features in a nutshell:  
- Capability to store your ABAP developments in Git repositories.
- Central version management \- Git server \- (GitHub, for example) for cloud storage.  
- Central remote repository (GitHub repository, for example)  
- Multirepository support<br/>You can have multiple repositories on one ABAP system. For example, you could have one repository for each project.  
- Possibility to clone the remote repository to the repository on the ABAP development system.  
- Development process remains in the ABAP development system (ADT, for example).  
- Support and versioning for all ABAP development and Customizing objects  
- Capability to commit ABAP objects and push the commits to the remote repository.  
- Provisioning of objects in the remote repository for every ABAP system that has a connection to the Git server.  
- Capability to pull changed objects to other systems (test system, for example). After the testing phase is completed, the objects can also be pulled to the production system.  
- A shared transport directory and import queues, which ensured the correct import sequence and prevented unwanted software downgrades in the classic CTS, are no longer required.  
- Leverage of the deployment and logging capabilities of the transport tools by internally working with transport data files, as known from the classic CTS.  
- SAP Fiori app for gCTS  
- Continuous integration capability  
- Performance improvements through aggregation of changes

https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/275739524c7348f0a0ab54fe1fe05954.html

To work with Git-enabled CTS, the following prerequisites must be fulfilled.  
SAP Fiori App for Git-Enabled Change and Transport System (gCTS app)  
The gCTS app is the starting point for your gCTS configuration activities as well as for using gCTS. To use the app, you must first implement it.  
For more information, see [App Implementation: Git-Enabled Change and Transport System](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9a281eac983f4f688d0deedc96b3c61c/202009.001/en-US/89e7c923ac7c46859ec87280bbf594d7.html).  

#### 2.1 App Implementation: Git-Enabled Change and Transport System (gCTS)  

App-specific implementation information for the Git-Enabled Change and Transport System (gCTS app)  

#### 2.1.1. Prerequisites  

Before implementing the app, ensure the following:  
- You’ve followed the steps described in the section [Implementing SAP Fiori Apps for Administrative, Configuration, and Extensibility Tasks](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9a281eac983f4f688d0deedc96b3c61c/202009.001/en-US/e9d78b6aa0fc4f0ea0f41408dbc8a7ad.html) in every system in which you want to use the gCTS app. We recommend that you use the embedded deployment scenario.
> Note  
> If you don’t use the embedded scenario, you must register and activate the OData service SCTS_GCTS_SRV in transaction SEGW. For more information, see [ODAta Services Consumption and Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/68bf513362174d54b58cddec28794093/202009.001/en-US/ae7822518bc72214e10000000a44176d.html).  

> => as already Fiori Apps are installed, this prerequisite is fullfilled

#### 2.1.2. System Landscape Requirements  

For information about the system requirements, see [SAP Fiori Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/22bbe89ef68b4d0e98d05f0d56a7f6c8/2020.001/en-US/4c1048feb4ea4f7d81ccbc47233a0d68.html).  

> => as already Fiori Apps are installed, this prerequisite is fullfilled

#### 2.1.3. Implementation Tasks  

The following sections list tasks that you have to perform to implement this app. The tables contain the app-specific data required for these tasks.
> Note  
> You can also find the data required to perform these tasks in the [SAP Fiori apps reference library](https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/index.html?appId=F4158).

> Note  
> Since we recommend embedded deployment, perform the following steps on the SAP S/4HANA system.  

a. Activate OData Service  

Component   	| External Technical Name
------------- | -----------------------
OData Service	| SCTS_GCTS_SRV

To do this, activate the OData service in transaction /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE of your ABAP system. For the embedded deployment scenario, choose Local as System Alias:  
For more information about activating OData services, see [Activating OData Services for Individual Apps](https://help.sap.com/viewer/22bbe89ef68b4d0e98d05f0d56a7f6c8/2020.001/en-US/e4d8492f6f9845b6b24eafffefc7b7dc.html) in the SAP Fiori Overview documentation  
> => DONE  

As Service is not available, you have to add it
![gCTS Add Selected Service](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_add_sel_ser.png)
![gCTS Add Service Details](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_add_serv_det.png)
> => Result: Service ZSCTS_GCTS_SRV activated

b. Activate ICF Services

Component   |	Technical Name
----------- | -----------------------
ICF Service |	/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/bc_cts_git

Component	  | Technical Name
----------- | -----------------------
ICF Service	| /sap/bc/cts_abapvcs

To do this, in your ABAP system, in transaction SICF, under Service Name, enter bc_cts_git, and choose Execute  
For more information about how to activate ICF services, see [Activate ICF Services of SAPUI5 Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/22bbe89ef68b4d0e98d05f0d56a7f6c8/2020.001/en-US/0e263e53a97fe547e10000000a441470.html) in the SAP Fiori Overview documentation.  
> => Services activated

c. Create PFCG Role for gCTS and Assign Launchpad Catalogs and Groups

SAP delivers technical catalogs for groups of apps as repositories. Along with these catalogs, more technical content is delivered for each SAP Fiori app. You can find the delivered technical content for each SAP Fiori app in the SAP Fiori apps reference library.  
The gCTS app is part of the SAP_BASIS_TCR_T (SAP: Application Services) catalog. To add the catalog to a role, proceed as follows:  
i.   
In transaction PFCG, create a new role for gCTS users as a copy of the delivered role SAP_BC_GCTS_ADMIN, or select an existing role to which you assign the authorizations of the gCTS role.  
For more information about the authorizations of this role, see [Prerequisites for Git-Enabled Change and Transport System](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9a281eac983f4f688d0deedc96b3c61c/202009.001/en-US/275739524c7348f0a0ab54fe1fe05954.html).  
ii.  
In change mode of the user role, on the Menu tab, choose the dropdown menu next to the field with the quick info Insert Node.  
In the following screenshot, this is the icon next to the 
![Next](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_but_next.png) field with the text: Transaction.  
iii.  
Select SAP Fiori Launchpad  SAP Fiori Tile Catalog from the dropdown box.  
![PFCG](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_pfcg_menu_flp.png)  
iv.  
On the Assign SAP Fiori Launchpad Catalog dialog box, proceed as follows:
1) Leave Local Front-End Server selected.
2) Use the input help to select the Catalog ID SAP_BASIS_TCR_T.
3) Leave the Include Applications checkbox selected.
4) Choose Enter 
 
![FLP Catalog](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_pfcg_flp_cat.png)  
falls der SAP Standard Catlog nicht gefunden wird, besser als Catalog eingeben:
```X-SAP-UI2-CATALOGPAGE:SAP_BASIS_TCR_T```
![Correct FLP Catalog](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_pfcg_flp_cat_correct.png)
no F4 search, press "ok" directly, ignore message and save  
The correct  CatalogID can be found via FLP designer (/UI2/FLPD_CUST), search for SAP_BASIS_TCR_T and use the correct id from your system
![FLP Designer](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_flp_desig_cat.png)		

Add missing authorizations in the tab "Authorizations".  
Choose "Insert Full Authorization" to each group until everything is green  
![PFCG Authorizations](/assets/img/vsapworkspace/gcts_pfcg_auth.png)  
save and activate changes  
v.  
Assign this role to all users that will use the gCTS app.
For more information, see [Creating Authorization Roles for Catalogs](https://help.sap.com/viewer/22bbe89ef68b4d0e98d05f0d56a7f6c8/2020.001/en-US/6f0e415370107d77e10000000a441470.html) in the SAP Fiori Overview documentation.

d. Result

The app is now available in SAP Fiori Launchpad for all users that have assigned the user role. All users can add the app to their SAP Fiori Launchpad by using the app finder in their user settings.  
The application called Git-enabled CTS is available in the SAP: Application Services catalog.

#### 3.4. Decide about how you want to set up authentication between ABAP systems and remote Git repositories.

The following options are available:
- User-specific authentication  
  All users specify their own credentials to the remote Git repositories they work with. For more information, see [Set User-Specific Authentication](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/3431ebd6fbf241778cd60587e7b5dc3e.html).  
  > => s. screenshot above [generate GITHUB Token](#33-to-work-with-git-repositories-configure-git-repositories-on-the-abap-system)

  > Recommendation  
  > We recommend that you use this option.
- Repository-specific authentication
  You can specify authentication of a technical user to remote Git repositories. As a result, all users who work with remote repositories use the technical user for authentication. For more information, see [Repository-Specific Authentication Options](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/9e7368baf25641af8b65996ac97f5db0.html).

#### 3.5. Define which ABAP packages you want to manage with gCTS

This is necessary, if you use gCTS for development projects. For more information, see [Define ABAP Packages as Managed by Git-Enabled Change and Transport System](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/d7ffc00f4f304f4a9e7a13a09878980d.html).  
If you use gCTS for Customizing projects, see [Use gCTS for Customizing Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/a4000640596f4939a291287680e31bb3.html).

For information about troubleshooting gCTS, see the guided answer [Troubleshooting Git-Enabled Change and Transport System](http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/2504/actions/34024)  

#### 5.1. Manually Checking whether the gCTS Observer Job was Scheduled

https://help.sap.com/viewer/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/202009.001/en-US/db778a446db942deafdbcfc5dcfa029d.html  
The gCTS observer job is usually scheduled as part of the Enable gCTS wizard process.  
Context  
If the Health Check displays that no observer job was scheduled, you can manually check this. The name of the job is SCTS_ABAP_VCS_IMPORT_OBSERVER. Proceed as follows:  
Procedure
- In SAP GUI, start transaction SM37.
- Enter the following selection criteria:  
  Field Name | User Input  
  ---------- | ----------
  Job Name | SCTS_ABAP_VCS_IMPORT_OBSERVER
  User Name | The job is scheduled for the logon user. You can enter the name of the logon user. Alternatively, you can use * to perform the search for all users.
  Job Status | You can leave the default selection unchanged.
  Job Start Condition | Select a valid date range.<br/>As input for the field Or after event, select the value SAP_TRIGGER_VCS_IMPORT from the dropdown list.
- Choose Execute.
- The result should show the job in the status Released.
- If no job is displayed, or if the job has a status other than Released, the observer job is not scheduled and the system was not initialized.
