# Using Github pages as a blog

[sbasischeck.github.io](https://sbasischeck.github.io/)  
This is using github
pages and Jekyll to make a blog. You can subscribe to the RSS in
the blog or to changes in the repo using github.

If you want something fixed, fork it and submit a MR.

If you do not like the format, clone it and process yourself.
